	 * slides or section 19.4 of the text if you need a refresher on the
	 * definition.) I use character as the data type here for convenience in
	 * writing tests, but your method shouldn't need to look at the node data at
	 * all.
	 * 
	 * You earn the efficiency points by making sure that your method runs in
	 * O(n) time, where n is the size of the tree, by using a single recursive
	 * traversal that does not (i) visit any node more than once, or (ii) use
	 * any extra data structure whose size depends on the size of the tree
	 * (other than the stack that Java uses to keep track of recursive calls, of
	 * course). Focus on correctness first. 
	 * 
	 * You may not include any other fields like balance codes in the BinaryTree
	 * or BinaryNode classes. You also may not modify the given insert() method
	 * in any way.
	 * 
	 * However, you may add helper methods with parameters and return values of
	 * any type, including a class that you define.
	 *
